- FAID.m produces Figures 3-4 (with valuematrixuniform.m)
and 5-6 (with valuematrixrealistic.m) and Figures 1-2 by trivial application.
- Figure7.m produces Figure 7-8

IMPORTANT: Notice that the function intlinprog, necessary to solve the SPLIDDIT problem,
cannot be run on Matlab on a M-based Apple computer.
